# Project Atelier:
A complete redesign of a retail portal.

# Installation:
- run the command `npm install` in the project root.
- create a local file `.env` using `example.env` as a template.
  - It is listed in the `.gitignore` file and thus will not be added to Git's source control
  - Populate this new `.env` file with the required values for your local machine
